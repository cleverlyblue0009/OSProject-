## 1. Processes vs Threads

### Theory

- **Process**: Independent program with its own memory space
- **Thread**: Lightweight execution unit within a process, shares memory

### In Our Application

We use **threads** (not processes) because:
- All chefs and waiters need to access the **same** kitchen counter (shared buffer)
- Threads share memory space, making this easy
- Lower overhead than processes

**Code Example**: `producer.py:40-45`
```python
class Chef(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__(name=f"Chef-{chef_id}-{name}", daemon=True)
```

Each Chef is a thread that inherits from `threading.Thread`.

---

## 2. Producer-Consumer Problem

### Theory

Classic synchronization problem:
- **Producers** create data items
- **Consumers** process data items
- They share a **bounded buffer**
- Must coordinate to avoid:
  - Producers adding to full buffer
  - Consumers removing from empty buffer

### In Our Application

- **Producers**: Chefs creating orders
- **Consumers**: Waiters delivering orders
- **Buffer**: Kitchen counter (fixed size)

**Visual Flow**:
```
Chefs (Producers)  ‚Üí  Kitchen Counter  ‚Üí  Waiters (Consumers)
    Create Orders  ‚Üí  [Bounded Buffer]  ‚Üí  Deliver Orders
```

**Why It's Important**: Demonstrates real-world scenarios like:
- Print spooler (producer: apps, consumer: printer)
- Network packets (producer: sender, consumer: receiver)
- Assembly line (producer: worker, consumer: next station)

---

## 3. Semaphores

### Theory

A semaphore is a **synchronization primitive** with:
- An integer counter
- Two operations:
  - **P (wait/acquire)**: Decrement counter, block if zero
  - **V (signal/release)**: Increment counter, wake waiting thread

### In Our Application

We use **two semaphores**:

#### 1. Empty Slots Semaphore
```python
empty_slots = Semaphore(capacity)  # Initially: capacity
```
- **Tracks**: Number of empty buffer slots
- **Producers wait on this**: "Is there space to add an order?"
- **Consumers signal this**: "I removed an order, space available!"

#### 2. Full Slots Semaphore
```python
full_slots = Semaphore(0)  # Initially: 0
```
- **Tracks**: Number of filled buffer slots
- **Consumers wait on this**: "Is there an order to pick up?"
- **Producers signal this**: "I added an order, come get it!"

**Code Example**: `shared_buffer.py:40-46`

### How They Work Together

**Producer (Chef) Adds Order**:
```python
empty_slots.acquire()    # Wait for space (P operation)
# ... add order to buffer ...
full_slots.release()     # Signal order available (V operation)
```

**Consumer (Waiter) Removes Order**:
```python
full_slots.acquire()     # Wait for order (P operation)
# ... remove order from buffer ...
empty_slots.release()    # Signal space available (V operation)
```

### Why Semaphores?

They automatically:
- Block threads when resource unavailable
- Wake threads when resource becomes available
- Count available resources
- Prevent busy-waiting (CPU efficiency)

---

## 4. Mutex Locks

### Theory

**Mutex** (Mutual Exclusion) ensures only **one thread** accesses a critical section at a time.

Think of it as a bathroom key:
- Only one person can hold the key
- Others must wait outside
- When done, pass key to next person

### In Our Application

The mutex protects the buffer itself:

```python
self.mutex = threading.Lock()
```

**Code Example**: `shared_buffer.py:97-103`
```python
self.mutex.acquire()       # Lock the door
# === CRITICAL SECTION ===
order.mark_ready()
self.buffer.append(order)
# === END CRITICAL SECTION ===
self.mutex.release()       # Unlock the door
```

### Why Do We Need BOTH Semaphores AND Mutex?

- **Semaphores**: Control **how many** threads can proceed (counting)
- **Mutex**: Ensures **only one** thread modifies buffer at a time (exclusion)

**Example Without Mutex**:
```
Thread A reads buffer length: 5
Thread B reads buffer length: 5
Thread A writes at position 5
Thread B writes at position 5  ‚Üê COLLISION! Data corrupted
```

**With Mutex**:
```
Thread A acquires mutex ‚Üí reads length 5 ‚Üí writes at 5 ‚Üí releases mutex
Thread B acquires mutex ‚Üí reads length 6 ‚Üí writes at 6 ‚Üí releases mutex
```

## 5. Critical Sections

### Theory

A **critical section** is code that:
- Accesses shared resources
- Must NOT be executed by multiple threads simultaneously
- Requires mutual exclusion

### In Our Application

**Critical Section #1**: Adding to Buffer
```python
# shared_buffer.py:97-103
self.mutex.acquire()
# === CRITICAL SECTION START ===
order.mark_ready()           # Modify order state
self.buffer.append(order)    # Modify shared buffer
# === CRITICAL SECTION END ===
self.mutex.release()
```

**Critical Section #2**: Removing from Buffer
```python
# shared_buffer.py:142-148
self.mutex.acquire()
# === CRITICAL SECTION START ===
if self.buffer:
    order = self.buffer.popleft()  # Modify shared buffer
# === CRITICAL SECTION END ===
self.mutex.release()
```

### Properties of Good Critical Section Design

1. ‚úÖ **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one thread at a time
2. ‚úÖ **Progress**: If no thread in CS, one waiting can enter
3. ‚úÖ **Bounded Waiting**: No thread waits forever
4. ‚úÖ **Short Duration**: Critical section is brief

Our implementation satisfies all four properties!

## 6. Thread States

### Theory

Threads transition through states:
- **NEW**: Created but not started
- **READY**: Ready to run, waiting for CPU
- **RUNNING**: Executing on CPU
- **WAITING**: Blocked waiting for resource
- **BLOCKED**: Blocked by synchronization
- **TERMINATED**: Finished execution

### In Our Application

We track and visualize three main states:

#### üü¢ RUNNING
```python
self._state = "RUNNING"
```
- Thread is actively working
- Preparing orders (chefs)
- Delivering orders (waiters)

#### üü° WAITING
```python
self._state = "WAITING"
```
- Thread is blocked by semaphore
- Chef waiting for buffer space
- Waiter waiting for order

#### üî¥ BLOCKED
```python
self._state = "BLOCKED"
```
- Thread is paused by user
- Timeout occurred
- Error condition

**State Transitions**:
```
START ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí WAITING ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí WAITING ‚Üí ... ‚Üí IDLE
                    ‚Üë  ‚Üì
                  BLOCKED
```

**Code Example**: `producer.py:133-159`

### Why Visualize States?

- **Educational**: Students see thread lifecycle
- **Debugging**: Identify bottlenecks (lots of WAITING)
- **Understanding**: Observe OS scheduling behavior

## 7. Deadlock

### Theory

**Deadlock**: Situation where threads wait forever for each other.

**Four Necessary Conditions (Coffman conditions)**:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources can't be shared
2. **Hold and Wait**: Thread holds resource while waiting for another
3. **No Preemption**: Can't force thread to release resource
4. **Circular Wait**: Circular chain of waiting threads

**All four must be true** for deadlock to occur.

### Prevention in Our Application

We prevent deadlock by breaking **Circular Wait**:

#### 1. Resource Ordering
Always acquire resources in same order:
```
1. First: Acquire semaphore
2. Then: Acquire mutex
3. Modify buffer
4. Release mutex
5. Release other semaphore
```

#### 2. Timeouts
```python
# shared_buffer.py:88
acquired = self.empty_slots.acquire(blocking=True, timeout=10.0)
if not acquired:
    return False  # Give up instead of waiting forever
```

#### 3. No Hold and Wait
We don't hold any lock while waiting for another:
```python
# Get semaphore first (may block, but holds nothing)
empty_slots.acquire()

# Then get mutex (quick, won't block long)
mutex.acquire()
```

### Testing for Deadlock

**Try This**: 
1. Start simulation
2. Pause/Resume repeatedly
3. Let it run for 10+ minutes
4. No deadlock should occur!

---

## 8. Race Conditions

### Theory

**Race Condition**: When output depends on timing/ordering of thread execution.

**Example** (without proper synchronization):
```python
# Two threads incrementing counter
count = 0

Thread A: temp = count      # Reads 0
Thread B: temp = count      # Reads 0
Thread A: count = temp + 1  # Writes 1
Thread B: count = temp + 1  # Writes 1 (should be 2!)
```

Result: Lost update!

### Prevention in Our Application

#### 1. Mutex Protection
```python
# shared_buffer.py:97
self.mutex.acquire()        # Only one thread here
self.buffer.append(order)   # Safe!
self.mutex.release()
```

#### 2. Separate Locks for Independent Data
```python
self._stats_lock = threading.Lock()  # Separate lock for stats
```
Stats don't need to lock the entire buffer!

#### 3. Thread-Safe Data Structures
```python
self.update_queue = queue.Queue()  # Thread-safe queue
```

### Testing for Race Conditions

**Stress Test**:
```
Chefs: 10
Waiters: 10
Buffer: 5
Speed: 5.0x
Run for 5 minutes
```

Check: `Orders Produced == Orders Delivered` (eventually)

If they match, no race condition! ‚úÖ

## 9. Synchronization

### Theory

**Synchronization**: Coordinating thread execution to ensure correctness.

**Goals**:
- Prevent race conditions
- Ensure proper ordering
- Avoid deadlock
- Maintain consistency

### Synchronization Mechanisms Used

#### 1. Semaphores
```python
empty_slots = Semaphore(capacity)
full_slots = Semaphore(0)
```
**Purpose**: Coordinate producer-consumer interaction

#### 2. Mutex Locks
```python
mutex = Lock()
```
**Purpose**: Protect critical sections

#### 3. Events
```python
stop_event = threading.Event()
pause_event = threading.Event()
```
**Purpose**: Signal threads to stop/pause

#### 4. Thread-Safe Queue
```python
update_queue = queue.Queue()
```
**Purpose**: Thread-to-GUI communication

### Synchronization Pattern

**Producer Pattern**:
```
1. Do work (no sync needed)
2. P(empty_slots)          ‚Üê Synchronization point
3. Lock mutex              ‚Üê Synchronization point
4. Modify buffer
5. Unlock mutex            ‚Üê Synchronization point
6. V(full_slots)           ‚Üê Synchronization point
```

**Consumer Pattern**:
```
1. P(full_slots)           ‚Üê Synchronization point
2. Lock mutex              ‚Üê Synchronization point
3. Modify buffer
4. Unlock mutex            ‚Üê Synchronization point
5. V(empty_slots)          ‚Üê Synchronization point
6. Do work (no sync needed)
```

## 10. Bounded Buffer

### Theory

**Bounded Buffer**: Fixed-size buffer shared between producers and consumers.

**Challenges**:
- Buffer overflow (add to full buffer)
- Buffer underflow (remove from empty buffer)
- Race conditions on buffer access

### Our Implementation

```python
class SharedBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = deque()  # Fixed max size
```

**Using Python's `deque`**:
- Efficient O(1) append/pop at both ends
- Thread-safe when combined with locks
- Natural FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior

### Buffer Operations

#### Produce (Add Order)
```python
def produce(self, order):
    empty_slots.acquire()    # Block if full
    mutex.acquire()
    buffer.append(order)     # Add to end
    mutex.release()
    full_slots.release()     # Signal consumers
```

#### Consume (Remove Order)
```python
def consume(self):
    full_slots.acquire()     # Block if empty
    mutex.acquire()
    order = buffer.popleft() # Remove from front
    mutex.release()
    empty_slots.release()    # Signal producers
    return order
```

### Capacity Management

**Invariant** (always true):
```
empty_slots.value + full_slots.value + threads_in_critical_section == capacity
```

Example with capacity=10:
- Buffer has 3 orders: `empty=7, full=3`
- Producer adds order: `empty=6, full=4`
- Consumer removes order: `empty=7, full=3`

### Visualization

```
Empty Buffer (capacity=10):
[][][][][][][][][]
empty_slots = 10
full_slots = 0

Partially Full:
[üçï][üçù][ü•ó][][][][][]
empty_slots = 7
full_slots = 3

Full Buffer:
[üçï][üçù][ü•ó][ü•©][üç§][üçî][üçú][üåÆ][üç±][ü•ò]
empty_slots = 0
full_slots = 10
```
