## üéØ Overview

The Restaurant Order Management System simulates a restaurant kitchen where:

- **üë®‚Äçüç≥ Chefs (Producers)** create orders and place them on a kitchen counter
- **üßë‚Äçüíº Waiters (Consumers)** pick up orders from the counter and deliver them to customers
- **üçΩÔ∏è Kitchen Counter (Shared Buffer)** has limited capacity, requiring proper synchronization
- **üîÑ Thread Synchronization** prevents race conditions and ensures data consistency

This simulation provides a real-world context for understanding complex OS concepts, making them accessible and engaging for students and educators.

## üñ•Ô∏è OS Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Producer-Consumer Pattern**
- **Producers (Chefs):** Generate orders and place them in the shared buffer
- **Consumers (Waiters):** Remove orders from the shared buffer and process them
- **Bounded Buffer:** Kitchen counter with fixed capacity (5-20 orders)

### 2. **Thread Synchronization**
- **Semaphores:** 
  - `empty_slots`: Counts available buffer spaces (producers wait on this)
  - `full_slots`: Counts occupied buffer spaces (consumers wait on this)
- **Mutex Locks:** Protect critical sections during buffer access
- **Critical Sections:** Buffer modification operations are atomic

### 3. **Concurrency Management**
- **Multiple Threads:** 1-8 chef and waiter threads running concurrently
- **Thread States:** Visual representation of RUNNING, WAITING, BLOCKED, PAUSED states
- **Race Condition Prevention:** Proper locking mechanisms ensure data integrity

### 4. **Deadlock Prevention**
- **Timeout Mechanisms:** Threads don't wait indefinitely for resources
- **Resource Ordering:** Consistent acquisition order prevents circular dependencies
- **Deadlock Detection:** System monitors for potential deadlock conditions

### 5. **Thread Lifecycle Management**
- **Thread Creation:** Dynamic thread spawning based on configuration
- **Thread Termination:** Graceful shutdown with proper cleanup
- **Thread Monitoring:** Real-time state tracking and performance metrics

mutex.acquire()            # Enter critical section
buffer.append(order)       # Add order to buffer
mutex.release()            # Exit critical section
full_slots.release()       # Signal new item available

# Consumer Algorithm (Waiter)
full_slots.acquire()       # Wait for full slot
mutex.acquire()            # Enter critical section
order = buffer.pop()       # Remove order from buffer
mutex.release()            # Exit critical section

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### 1. Normal Operation
- Start with default settings (3 chefs, 3 waiters, buffer size 10)
- Observe steady order flow and balanced thread utilization
- Verify no deadlocks or race conditions occur

### 2. Buffer Overflow Prevention
- Set 1 waiter and 5 chefs with small buffer (size 5)
- Observe chefs blocking when buffer is full
- Verify proper synchronization prevents overflow

### 3. Buffer Underflow Prevention
- Set 5 waiters and 1 chef with any buffer size
- Observe waiters blocking when buffer is empty
- Verify proper synchronization prevents underflow

### 4. Deadlock Prevention
- Test various thread combinations and buffer sizes
- Monitor for deadlock detection warnings
- Verify timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite blocking

### 5. Performance Testing
- Run with maximum threads (8 chefs, 8 waiters)
- Monitor system resource usage
- Test simulation at various speeds (0.1x to 5.0x)

### 6. Stress Testing
- Run simulation for extended periods (30+ minutes)
- Monitor memory usage and thread stability
- Test pause/resume functionality under load

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Check tkinter availability
python -c "import tkinter; print('tkinter available')"

# Run with debug logging
python main.py --log-level DEBUG
```

#### GUI Performance Issues
- Reduce number of threads (try 2-3 each)
- Decrease simulation speed
- Close other applications to free memory
- Check system requirements

#### Thread Synchronization Errors
- These should not occur in normal operation
- If they do, please report as a bug with log files
- Try resetting the simulation

#### Memory Usage
- The application typically uses 50-100MB of RAM
- Memory usage increases with thread count and simulation duration
- Reset simulation periodically for long-running tests

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
python main.py --log-level DEBUG --log-file debug.log
```

### System Requirements

- **Minimum:** Python 3.8, 512MB RAM, 50MB disk space
- **Recommended:** Python 3.9+, 1GB RAM, modern CPU
- **Display:** 1024x768 minimum resolution (1200x800 recommended)
