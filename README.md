## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. Verify Setup (Optional)
```bash
cd restaurant_system
python3 verify_setup.py
```

### 2. Run Application
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 3. Configure & Start
- Set number of chefs (1-10)
- Set number of waiters (1-10)
- Set buffer size (5-20)
- Click **START**

### 4. Observe & Learn
- Watch threads change states
- See buffer fill and empty
- Read activity log
- Monitor statistics

### 5. Experiment
- Try different configurations
- Adjust speed slider
- Pause and resume
- Test edge cases

---

## 🧪 Example Experiments

### Experiment 1: Buffer Overflow
**Settings:** 5 chefs, 1 waiter, buffer size 5
**Result:** Chefs frequently blocked (yellow) - demonstrates producer blocking

### Experiment 2: Buffer Underflow
**Settings:** 1 chef, 5 waiters, buffer size 5
**Result:** Waiters frequently blocked (yellow) - demonstrates consumer blocking

### Experiment 3: Balanced System
**Settings:** 3 chefs, 3 waiters, buffer size 10, speed 2.0x
**Result:** Smooth operation with minimal blocking - optimal configuration

### Experiment 4: High Contention
**Settings:** 10 chefs, 10 waiters, buffer size 5, speed 5.0x
**Result:** High activity with frequent blocking - stress test

DEFAULT_NUM_WAITERS = 3
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE = 10

# Timing
MIN_PREPARATION_TIME = 0.5
MAX_PREPARATION_TIME = 2.0
