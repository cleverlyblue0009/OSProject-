Multi-threaded Producer-Consumer Restaurant OrderÂ System

Covers Multiple OS Concepts:

Concurrency & Synchronization (Module 4) - Core focus with semaphores/mutexes
Process Management (Module 2) - Multiple threads representing different roles
Deadlock Prevention (Module 3) - Proper resource ordering

The Concept
Simulate a restaurant with:

Producer threads: Chefs preparing orders
Consumer threads: Waiters delivering orders
Shared buffer: Kitchen counter (bounded buffer problem)
Synchronization: Semaphores to prevent race conditions

What Makes It Impressive

Visual Appeal: Real-time GUI showing order flow, thread states, and synchronization
Clear OS Demonstration: Teacher can literally see threads waiting, accessing critical sections, and proper synchronization
Easy to Extend: Can add features like priority orders (scheduling), or multiple kitchens (resource allocation)

Implementation Suggestion
Use Python with Tkinter or Java Swing for quick development. Add colored indicators for:

ðŸ”´ Thread waiting (blocked)
ðŸŸ¢ Thread executing (running)
ðŸŸ¡ Buffer full/empty conditions

Deliverables

Working GUI application
Console logs showing thread IDs and synchronization events
Architecture diagram showing producer-consumer pattern
Documentation explaining semaphore usage and deadlock prevention
